password-manager
================

<h3>Simple password manager<br /></h3>
<p>This is a password manager I made in order to keep MVC and Swing fresh in my mind. This started as a terminal app I wrote in C++ and I decided to add a GUI to it and also added more functionality as well! <br /><br />

My password manager offers a very simplistic UI and allows users to store passwords they already have and randomly generate new ones as well as copying the passwords to the clipboard so they may be pasted where they are needed.<br /><br />

I had fun developing this (though I always think of something to add) and I feel it could serve as a decent starting point for others!

<h4>Compile and run using Maven</h4>
<hr>
<code>mvn install</code><br /><br />
Then to run Password Manager <br />
<p><code>mvn exec:java</code></p>
<br />
<p>Or you can use the jar-with-dependencies file generated in target by double clicking the file or using the command</p> <br /><br />
<code>java -jar \<jar-with-dependencies\>.jar</code><br /><br />
Though that assumes you have java in your path variable
