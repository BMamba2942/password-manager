password-manager
================

<h3>Simple password manager<br />
I have finally added Maven Support!</h3>
<h4>Compile and run using Maven</h4>
<hr>
<code>mvn install</code><br /><br />
Then to run Password Manager <br />
<p><code>mvn exec:java</code></p>
<br />
Or you can use the jar-with-dependencies file generated in target by double clicking the file or using the command <br />
<code>java -jar \<jar-with-dependencies\>.jar</code><br />
Though that assumes you have java in your path variable
